This package contains all of the BPG C++ tools:

  astats:     Alignment statistics
  kerf:       Subfamily identification
  newick2svg: Newick to SVG conversion

astats
------
Computes alignment statistics.

Usage: astats [-h] [-v] <msafile>

Output Key:
  FILE:            Input alignment filename
  SEQS:            Number of sequences
  COLS:            Number of columns (alignment length)
  SHORTEST:        Shortest sequence ID
  SHORTEST_LENGTH: Length of the shortest sequence
  LONGEST:         Longest sequence ID
  LONGEST_LENGTH:  Length of the longest sequence ID
  MINPID:          Minimum percent identity
  MAXPID:          Maximum percent identity
  MEANPID:         Mean percent identity
  PGAPS:           Percentage of gaps over entire alignment
  PCNAB62:         Percent of cols with average BLOSUM62 scores < 0
  NCNAB62:         Number of cols with average BLOSUM62 scores < 0
  MAXLENDIFF:      Difference in length between LONGEST and SHORTEST
  PLENDIFF:        Percent difference between LONGEST and SHORTEST

kerf
----
Given a Newick tree with boostrap values and a corresponding alignment,
cuts the tree into subfamilies with at least <minbs> bootstrap OR <minpid>
percent identity.

Usage: kerf <minbs> <minpid> <treefn> <msafn>

  <minbs>:  The minimum bootstrap (integer)
  <minpid>: The minimum percent identity (integer)
  <treefn>: The Newick tree file name
  <msafn>:  The alignment file name

Output Files:
  kerf.summary: A summary of all subfamilies
  kerf.trees:   Subfamily Newick trees separated by "%"
  kerf.seqs:    Subfamily alignments, separated by "%"
  kerf.tre:     All subfamilies in a multifurcating Newick tree
  kerf.svg:     The full tree as an SVG document

newick2svg
----------
Convert a Newick file to SVG.

Usage: newick2svg <treefn>

  <treefn>: The Newick tree file name

Output File:

  <treefn>.svg: The SVG file
