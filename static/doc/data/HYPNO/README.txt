HYPNO - HYbrid Protein NucleOtide phylogenetic gene tree reconstruction
================================================================================

Supplementary Data: Included in this directory is the benchmark data used for
validation of the HYPNO method. Subdirectories contain the trees and multiple
sequence alignments, for both nucleic acid and amino acid sequences, that were 
chosen from orthologous clades of a bpg (Berkeley Phylogenomics Group) protein 
family. Protein sequences were retrieved from UniProt, nucleic acid sequences
were retrieved using the HYPNO software, and trees were inferred with FastTree 
2 and rooted via midpoint method.
