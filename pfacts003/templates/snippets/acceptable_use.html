<h3>Acceptable Use Policy<h3>

<p>
The PhyloFacts/{{servername}} server is run on a strictly best-efforts basis.
We aim the service primarily at biologists trying to analyse their own
sequences, as such the service is designed for users who submit small numbers
of jobs to the queue in any given day.
</p>

<p>
We recognise that increasingly there are projects that need more substantial
access to the {{servername}} server, but our current web servers have only
limited capacity.
</p>

<p>
If we find that users are abusing the good faith of the service then their site
access may be restricted or in extreme cases blocked completely. We hope such
cases will be rare and we will only resort to blocking sites if repeat usage is
severely interfering with the service for other users.
</p>

<p>
Since XXXXXXXXXXX, users submitting small numbers of jobs will are prioritised
over those submitting large numbers. If you need high-priority, high-capacity
access to our server then please contact us to discuss purchasing dedicated
server capacity or the possibility of collaboration.
</p>

<p>
You remain welcome to make use of the free service, but only at the default low priority.
</p>
